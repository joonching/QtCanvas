### QtCanvas

#Project for ECE3574 Applicational Design (c++)

For this project I had to create a canvas gui where I could draw on the canvas by pressing 'x' or 'c'.
If I pressed 'c' then I could draw a circle and if pressed 'x' then I would draw a line.
I also had to do handle detection where as a drew a new shape I would have a handle on the edges of the shape.
For the circle I had to create handles at the top, bottom, right and left of circle. 
Each handle was also capable of snap detection where if the mouse moved over the handle it would light up.
Coordinates and position of the mouse was also live-fed to the top of the screen
